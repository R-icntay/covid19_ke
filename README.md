This [COVID-19 in Kenya Dashboard](https://r-icntay.github.io/covid19_ke/#county-stats) seeks to provide an overview of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic.

The dashboard mainly focuses on Kenya by visualising the total reported cases, the daily reported cases and their distribution per county. 

It also visualises the total cases globally and then focuses on the cases in Africa and its respective countries.


### Data

The input data for this dashboard is the [coronavirus R package](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) (dev version) by [Rami Krispin](https://twitter.com/Rami_Krispin) and the [Ministry of Health, Kenya](http://www.health.go.ke/).
The data and dashboard is refreshed on a daily bases.
The raw data pulled from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) [Coronavirus repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

This dashboard was build with the hope that it will help everyone, especially in Kenya, to keep an eye on the outbreak.
